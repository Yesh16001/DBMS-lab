# 🏋️ Gym Management System – DBMS Project

A comprehensive Gym Management System developed using MySQL and Oracle SQL (PL/SQL), demonstrating essential database operations such as table creation, joins, subqueries, views, triggers, indexes, and stored procedures.

## 📁 Contents

- `All_Dbms_Practicals.sql` – Contains all table creation scripts, joins, subqueries, triggers, views, and PL/SQL procedure
- `README.md` – Project documentation and setup guide

## 📌 Features Implemented

- 🗃️ **Table Creation**: `diet_plans`, `trainers`, `training_schedules`, `gym_facilities`, `staff`, `members`, `fees`
- 🔍 **Subqueries**: Extract members with specific diets, trainers for specific sessions, and facilities with specific schedules
- 🔗 **Joins**: Includes Inner, Left, Right, Full (via Union), and Self Joins
- 👀 **Views**: Simplified view linking members with trainers and diet plans
- ⚙️ **Indexes**: Improve performance on member name and session date searches
- ⚠️ **Triggers**: Validate fee amount before insertion
- 💾 **PL/SQL Procedure**: Simulate fee payment with exception handling

## 💻 Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- MySQL Workbench or compatible MySQL environment
- Oracle SQL*Plus or Oracle Live SQL for PL/SQL execution
- Git and GitHub (for version tracking and collaboration)

### To Run:

1. Import and execute the `All_Dbms_Practicals.sql` script in your MySQL environment
2. For PL/SQL, copy the stored procedure into Oracle SQL*Plus or Oracle Live SQL

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- In-depth understanding of SQL through a real-world gym database
- Experience in designing relational models and enforcing data integrity
- Practice in integrating MySQL and Oracle SQL features within one project
